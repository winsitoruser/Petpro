# ELK Stack Security Hardening

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the PetPro ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to ensure data protection, access control, and operational security.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **Native Authentication**: Enabled X-Pack security in Elasticsearch for username/password authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Created custom roles with specific permissions:
  - `petpro_log_reader`: Read-only access to logs for developers
  - `petpro_log_writer`: Write access to logs for application services
- **Custom User Accounts**:
  - `petpro_app`: Application service account for backend logging
  - `petpro_dev`: Developer account with read-only access
  - Built-in system accounts (`elastic`, `kibana_system`, `logstash_system`)

### 2. Encryption & Transport Security

- **SSL/TLS for Transport Layer**: Enabled SSL for internal Elasticsearch node-to-node communications
- **Certificates Management**: Auto-generation of certificates during initialization
- **Encrypted Communications**: Secured communication between ELK components
- **Secured Settings**: Kibana encryption keys for saved objects

### 3. Data Protection

- **Index Lifecycle Management**: Automatic rotation and management of log indices
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Capture and retain failed log entries for diagnosis
- **Audit Logging**: Track security-relevant operations in Elasticsearch
- **Secure Password Storage**: Environment variables for sensitive credentials

### 4. Network Security

- **Network Isolation**: All ELK components run on a dedicated Docker network
- **Port Restrictions**: Minimized exposed ports
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of service health

### 5. Resource Protection

- **Memory Lock**: Prevents Elasticsearch memory from being swapped to disk
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits for all services
- **Ulimits Configuration**: Proper system limits for Elasticsearch operation

## Security Configuration Details

### Elasticsearch

- **Authentication**: Native realm with password-based auth
- **Certificate Management**: PKI-based node authentication
- **Node Security**: Single-node discovery type with memory lock
- **Audit Trail**: Security audit logging enabled
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypted settings for sensitive configuration

### Logstash

- **Input Security**: TCP/UDP inputs with structured data validation
- **Processing Security**: Data enrichment and sanitization
- **Output Security**: Authenticated output to Elasticsearch
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queues for failed events
- **Monitoring**: Internal monitoring via X-Pack

### Kibana

- **Authentication**: Basic auth with Elasticsearch backend
- **Encryption**: Encrypted saved objects with encryption keys
- **Spaces**: Separate spaces for different team functions
- **Alerting**: Secure alerting with email delivery
- **Dashboards**: Pre-configured secure dashboards for different roles

## Security Initialization Process

The secure ELK stack is initialized through a controlled process:

1. Certificate generation for secure communications
2. Secure bootstrap of Elasticsearch with basic security
3. Creation of roles and users with appropriate permissions
4. Secure startup of Logstash and Kibana with authentication
5. Initialization of dashboards, alerts, and index patterns

## Production Security Recommendations

For production deployment, consider these additional security measures:

1. **TLS Everywhere**: Enable HTTPS for all external interfaces
2. **Network Firewall**: Implement network-level access controls
3. **Regular Credential Rotation**: Change passwords periodically
4. **Security Monitoring**: Enable security audit logging and monitoring
5. **Backup Encryption**: Ensure all backups are encrypted
6. **IP Filtering**: Restrict access by IP address where appropriate
7. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add MFA for admin access
8. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated with security patches

## Environment Variables

Security-related environment variables used by the ELK stack:

- `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`: Superuser password for Elasticsearch
- `KIBANA_PASSWORD`: Password for Kibana system user
- `LOGSTASH_PASSWORD`: Password for Logstash system user
- `KIBANA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Secret key for encrypting saved objects
- `KIBANA_SMTP_PASSWORD`: Password for email alerting

These should be securely managed and never committed to source control.

## Initialization Script

The `elk-stack-init.sh` script handles the secure initialization process, ensuring:

1. Generation of secure certificates
2. Creation of security users and roles
3. Proper service startup order
4. Initialization of secure dashboards and alerts

Run this script when deploying the ELK stack to ensure all security measures are properly applied.
