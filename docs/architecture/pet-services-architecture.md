## API Design

All pet-related APIs follow RESTful principles with the following common patterns:

1. **Resource-based endpoints**: /pets, /pet-health-records, /pet-hotel-bookings
2. **CRUD operations**: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
3. **Query parameters**: Support filtering (e.g., by petId, date range)

5. **Authorization**: Role and ownership-based authorization guards
6. **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI annotations for all endpoints
