# Customer Data Analytics Architecture

## Overview

The Customer Data Analytics module provides comprehensive insights into customer behavior, engagement, and business metrics for the PetPro admin platform. This document outlines the architecture, data flow, and implementation details of this module.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Collection Layer

- **Activities Tracking Service**: Records all customer interactions as structured activity events
- **Event Emitter System**: Real-time activity event broadcasting
- **Activity Types**: Comprehensive taxonomy of user actions (login, booking, payment, reviews, etc.)
- **Metadata Capture**: Contextual data collection with each activity (device, location, etc.)

### 2. Data Processing Layer

- **Analytics Service**: Aggregates and processes raw activity data into meaningful metrics
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Temporal analysis of customer behavior patterns
- **Cohort Analysis**: Customer segmentation and retention tracking
- **Statistical Processing**: Deriving trends, anomalies, and patterns

### 3. Data Presentation Layer

- **Admin Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of customer analytics
- **Chart Components**: Line, bar, pie, and other visualization components
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Time range, activity type, and demographic filters
- **Exportable Reports**: Data export in standard formats

## Database Schema

### Activities Table

| Column      | Type         | Description                                    |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| id          | UUID         | Primary key                                    |
| user_id     | UUID         | Foreign key to users table                     |
| type        | ENUM         | Type of activity (login, booking, etc.)        |
| description | TEXT         | Human-readable description of the activity     |
| metadata    | JSONB        | Additional contextual data                     |
| ip_address  | VARCHAR      | IP address where activity originated           |
| user_agent  | TEXT         | User agent information                         |
| timestamp   | TIMESTAMP    | When the activity occurred                     |
| created_at  | TIMESTAMP    | When the record was created                    |
| updated_at  | TIMESTAMP    | When the record was last updated               |

## Data Flow

1. **Collection**:
   - User performs an action in the application
   - Activity is recorded via ActivitiesService
   - Event is emitted for real-time subscribers

2. **Processing**:
   - Analytics service processes raw activity data
   - Time-series aggregation provides temporal insights
   - Statistical methods derive business metrics

3. **Presentation**:
   - Admin dashboard queries analytics endpoints
   - Data is visualized through interactive charts
   - Filters enable deep exploration of metrics

## API Endpoints

### Analytics API

| Endpoint                    | Method | Description                             |
|-----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| /analytics/customer-growth  | GET    | Customer acquisition metrics over time  |
| /analytics/customer-activity| GET    | Customer activity patterns              |
| /analytics/customer-demographics | GET | Customer demographic insights         |
| /analytics/service-usage    | GET    | Service popularity and usage metrics    |
| /analytics/customer-retention | GET  | Customer retention and churn metrics    |

### Activities API

| Endpoint                    | Method | Description                             |
|-----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| /activities                 | POST   | Create activity record (admin/system)   |
| /activities/user/:userId    | GET    | Get user's activity history             |
| /activities/recent          | GET    | Get recent activities (admin only)      |
| /activities/statistics      | GET    | Get activity statistics                 |

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Auth Service**: User authentication and profile data
- **Booking Service**: Service usage and appointment data
- **Payment Service**: Transaction and revenue data
- **Notification Service**: Alert generation for significant metrics

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Role-based access with admin-only analytics endpoints
- **Data Privacy**: PII handling compliant with data protection regulations
- **Audit Trail**: All admin access to analytics is logged

## Implementation Details

### Backend (NestJS)

- **Activities Module**: Records and queries user activities
- **Analytics Module**: Processes activities into business metrics
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized for time-series queries
- **Caching Layer**: Redis caching for frequently accessed metrics

### Frontend (React)

- **CustomerAnalytics Component**: Main dashboard interface
- **ChartJS Integration**: Rich interactive visualizations
- **DateFns**: Date manipulation and formatting
- **Material UI**: Rich UI components for filters and controls

## Future Enhancements

1. **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning for customer behavior prediction
2. **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing for instant metric updates
3. **Advanced Segmentation**: Multi-dimensional customer segmentation
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Personalized service recommendations
5. **Export Capabilities**: PDF report generation for stakeholders
