# PetPro Vendor Dashboard Platform Compatibility Matrix

This document outlines the compatibility and behavior differences for API endpoints across different platforms (desktop vs mobile). Use this guide to ensure a consistent user experience across all devices.

## Response Format Optimization

| Platform | Response Adaptation |
|----------|---------------------|
| Desktop | Full data payload with complete metadata |
| Mobile | Optimized payloads with reduced metadata where applicable |
| Tablet | Adaptive based on screen orientation |

## Endpoint-Specific Behavior

### Authentication and General

| API Endpoint | Desktop Behavior | Mobile Behavior | Notes |

| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | Standard JWT flow | Supports biometric authentication | Mobile includes device registration for push notifications |
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/me` | Returns full vendor profile | Returns essential profile data | Mobile response excludes certain details to reduce payload size |

### Orders Management

| API Endpoint | Desktop Behavior | Mobile Behavior | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/orders` | Supports advanced filtering and batch actions | Simplified filtering, optimized for touch | Mobile limits records per page (10 vs 25) |
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/orders/{orderId}` | Full order details with related data | Essential order details | Mobile excludes certain analytics data |
| `PATCH /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/orders/{orderId}` | All update options available | Limited to essential status updates | Mobile optimizes for quick actions |

### Appointments Management

| API Endpoint | Desktop Behavior | Mobile Behavior | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/appointments` | Calendar and list views with full functionality | Optimized list view prioritizing today's appointments | Mobile focuses on immediate actions |
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/appointments/calendar` | Full month/week/day visualization | Limited to 3-day view | Touch-optimized date selection |

### Inventory Management

| API Endpoint | Desktop Behavior | Mobile Behavior | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/products` | Full product management capabilities | Limited to essential product data | Mobile supports barcode scanning |
| `PATCH /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/products/{productId}/stock` | Batch stock updates supported | Single product updates only | Mobile includes camera integration for barcode scanning |

### Analytics Dashboard

| API Endpoint | Desktop Behavior | Mobile Behavior | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/analytics/dashboard` | Full dashboard with all metrics | Limited to key performance indicators | Mobile provides simplified visualizations |
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/analytics/sales` | Detailed charts with drilldown | Simplified charts focusing on trends | Mobile reduces data points for performance |

### Settings Management

| API Endpoint | Desktop Behavior | Mobile Behavior | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `GET /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/settings` | All settings categories available | Limited to essential settings | Mobile excludes complex configuration options |
| `PATCH /api/v1/vendors/{vendorId}/settings/business-info` | Full form editing | Limited editing capabilities | Mobile may require additional confirmation steps |

## UI Component Adaptations

### Data Tables

| Feature | Desktop Implementation | Mobile Implementation |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Pagination | 25-50 items per page with advanced controls | 10 items per page with simple next/previous |
| Sorting | Multi-column sorting | Single column sorting |
| Filtering | Advanced filter panel with multiple conditions | Essential filters with simplified interface |

### Forms

| Feature | Desktop Implementation | Mobile Implementation |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Layout | Multi-column forms with side panels | Single column forms with progressive disclosure |
| Validation | Real-time validation with detailed feedback | On-submit validation with essential feedback |
| File Uploads | Drag and drop + file selection | Camera integration + file selection |

## Performance Considerations

| Aspect | Desktop Optimization | Mobile Optimization |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| API Polling | Up to 30 second refresh intervals | Reduced polling or manual refresh |
| Image Quality | High resolution | Adaptive based on connection speed |
| Caching | Standard TTL | Extended TTL for offline capability |
| Error Handling | Detailed error messages | Simplified messages with recovery options |

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Responsive Design Principles**
   - Use fluid grids and flexible images
   - Implement mobile-first CSS with appropriate breakpoints
   - Test on actual devices, not just emulators

2. **API Implementation**
   - Use User-Agent detection for platform-specific optimizations
   - Implement query parameter `?platform=mobile|desktop` as override
   - Cache appropriately based on platform

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark API response times across platforms
   - Optimize client-side rendering for lower-powered devices
   - Implement progressive loading for complex views on mobile

## Testing Requirements

Ensure all endpoints are tested across platforms with the following test cases:

1. **Connectivity Testing**
   - Test with various connection speeds (4G, 3G, slow 3G)
   - Test offline capability where applicable

2. **Device Testing**
   - Test on minimum 3 iOS and 3 Android device types
   - Test on tablets in both orientations
   - Test on desktop browsers at various window sizes

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test all platform-specific features (camera, biometrics, etc.)
   - Verify data consistency across platforms
