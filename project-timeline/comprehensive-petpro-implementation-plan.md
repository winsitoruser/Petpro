   - Integration Testing in Staging Environment
   - Monitoring Configuration

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Microservice communication complexity | High | Medium | Clear API contracts, comprehensive testing, service discovery |
| Mobile app performance on older devices | Medium | Medium | Performance testing on range of devices, optimization sprints |
| Database scaling challenges | High | Low | Early load testing, sharding strategy, connection pooling |
| Integration issues between services | Medium | High | Clear API specifications, contract testing, integration test suite |
| UI/UX inconsistency across platforms | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive design system, component library, style guides |

## Definition of Done

1. All user stories meet their acceptance criteria
2. Code passes code review and is merged to main branch
3. Automated tests cover minimum 80% of new code
4. Documentation is updated to reflect changes
5. Feature is deployable to production environment
6. Performance meets established benchmarks
7. No critical or high severity bugs remain
8. Product owner has verified functionality
