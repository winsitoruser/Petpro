## Definition of Done

Each sprint is considered complete when:

1. All user stories meet their acceptance criteria
2. Code passes code review and is merged to main branch
3. Automated tests cover minimum 80% of new code
4. Documentation is updated to reflect changes
5. Feature is deployable to production environment
