|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Socket.IO performance bottlenecks at scale | High | Medium | Early load testing, horizontal scaling strategy |
| Mobile battery drain from persistent connections | Medium | High | Implement adaptive connection strategies, background optimization |
| Offline data conflicts | High | Medium | Robust conflict resolution, clear precedence rules |
| WebSocket security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Authentication middleware, rate limiting, penetration testing |
| Cross-platform inconsistencies in real-time behavior | Medium | Medium | Shared test scenarios, common event format documentation |
| Poor user experience with real-time updates | High | Medium | Early user testing, clear visual feedback patterns |
| Accessibility barriers in real-time interactions | Medium | Medium | Inclusive design patterns, alternative notification methods |

## Definition of Done

Each user story is considered complete when:

1. All associated tasks are implemented and code reviewed
2. Unit tests cover at least 80% of new code
3. E2E tests validate the user story acceptance criteria
4. Documentation is updated to reflect changes
5. Performance meets established benchmarks
6. Security review is completed for socket authentication and authorization
7. Product owner has verified the implementation meets business requirements

## Technical Debt Considerations

1. **Socket.IO Version Updates**: Plan for future updates to Socket.IO library with minimal disruption
2. **WebSocket Fallbacks**: Consider HTTP long-polling fallback mechanisms for environments that block WebSockets
3. **Event Schema Evolution**: Design event payloads with backward compatibility in mind
4. **Monitoring Overhead**: Balance comprehensive monitoring with performance impact
5. **Offline Storage Growth**: Implement cleanup strategies for offline cached data
